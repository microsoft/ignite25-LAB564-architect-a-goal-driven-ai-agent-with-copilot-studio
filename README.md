### Session Description

In this hands-on lab, you'll build an advanced agent inspired by AgentWise, our internal learning assistant designed to help developers understand types of ways for building agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot. Using Copilot Studio, you’ll architect a multi-layered agent that adapts to user goals, personalizes guidance based on persona, and makes intelligent decisions using structured flows and real-time data. Along the way, you’ll learn how to combine retrieval and dynamic logic to go beyond Q&A.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- build production-ready, goal-driven agents in Copilot Studio 
- use decision flows, real-time data, and adaptive logic
- gain practical skills in designing multi-layered agent architectures that personalize responses based on user goals and personas using the necessary knowledge and tools such as Azure AI Search and more.

This session provides best practices and frameworks for building intelligent, scalable agents that go beyond simple Q&A.

### 💻 Technologies Used
